This project was completed as part of the course 'Computing for Analytics'.

The following are the salient aspects of the project:

1. Create visualizations using Bokeh, Plotly to represent various sales characteristics of second-hand car purchases.
2. Used logistic regression, gradient boosting and random forest algorithms to predict the successful sale of a second-hand car.
3. Implemented using an object-oriented programming approach.
4. Used the concept of Monte Carlo simulation to simulate the best price for a second-hand car sell based on various customer segments.
5. The project focused on analyzing the computational aspect of applying various analytical technics.
